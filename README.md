### NOTICE: This repository has been deprecated. All my JS work is now on [typescript-tidbits](https://github.com/zeh/typescript-tidbits) (the TypeScript source is used to generate the JavaScript code).

zeh-js
======

More general JavaScript libraries, used in all my work.

Very much experimental. There's a lot of changes to be done in a bunch of them, e.g., ZTween.

Some of them may use package/object names that don't exist. I need to rewrite some of the declarations. The code itself works, though.
